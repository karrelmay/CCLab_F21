    <p>In typical popular fantasy Massively multiplayer online (MMO) games, players are usually tasked with missions to defeat monsters and obtain their drops. With reference to Genshin Impact, Slimes are these monster species players have to kill;
      however, rarely do we ask: how do slimes interact with each other and how do they grow? Where do they come from? Simply put, we rarely place ourselves on the other side of the spectrum as ‘monsters’. This lack of awareness often makes us lost
      in the gameplay and makes us less appreciative of the artistic and story telling elements game developers have developed for our enjoyment. Slime farming, a idle game project, offers a perspective on these slimes through a closed environment.
      As an interactive visual experience on understanding these ‘creatures’ (aka slimes), this simulation offers users (or in this case slime farmers) a chance to grow their own slime farm with the objective of growing as many Slimes as they can
      while having fun in a game-like way. In doing so, farmers will discover the unique properties, personalities, and compatibilities each type of slime has with respect to each other and understand this cute and gooey blobs in greater depth.
      Additionally, this experience offers an experience to appreciate the efforts Genshin Impact’s developers have put into their art and storytelling. </p>
